<li>Iâ€™m experienced with statistics and data science.</li>
<li>I ended up doing all the devops and all the things.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a recent graduate in statistics and economics. I'm passionate about working on data analysis with interdisciplinary teams and identifying practical insights. My areas of focus are computational statistics (especially Bayesian methods and non-parametric modelling), and I also have a background in financial analysis and biostatistics.</p>
<p>I have the most experience with the R ecosystem and using the GNU toolkit to prepare data, but I have also worked with Tensorflow and am always willing to learn new tools. I've learned techniques for working with time series data for econometrics and high-throughput data for genomics. Through personal projects, I also have a background in programming in Python and Scheme, as well as deploying web services to Linux machines, including using tools like Nix or Docker.</p>
<p>Outside of my specialties, some of my favorite courses across the engineering and business schools covered stochastic processes from a financial perspective, capital markets, and data structures.</p>
