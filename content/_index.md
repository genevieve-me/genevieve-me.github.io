I'm a data engineer based in New York, currently working remotely for The
Syllabus. I build and maintain data pipelines, APIs, and infrastructure
that turn large, messy text corpora into curated, human-scale insights. I
care a lot about observability, reproducibility, and making tools that
teammates actually enjoy using.
