Building up computer vision knowledge by implementing subtitle extraction techniques spanning decades of innovation - from classical algorithms to modern deep learning approaches.

The goal is to develop a practical understanding of how the field evolved, using the concrete problem of extracting hardcoded subtitles from video as a running example.
