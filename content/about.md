I'm a data engineer working remotely for [The Syllabus](https://www.thesyllabus.com/)

I studied statistics, data science and economics at Washington University.
I'm passionate about working on data analysis with interdisciplinary teams and identifying practical insights.
My areas of focus are computational statistics (especially Bayesian methods and non-parametric modelling), and I also have a background in financial analysis and biostatistics.

I have the most experience with the R ecosystem and using the GNU toolkit to prepare data, but I have also worked with Tensorflow and am always willing to learn new tools.
I've learned techniques for working with time series data for econometrics and high-throughput data for genomics.
When it comes to software engineering, I also have a background in programming in Python and Rust, as well as
software deployment with strong knowledge of fundamentals of Linux, containers, Terraform, and AWS.

When I have time, I want to keep learning Scheme and playing with Guix System.
I'm also interested in how data, policy, and climate resilience intersect in cities.
