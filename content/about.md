I'm an engineer working on ML and AI solutions. I currently work remotely for [The Syllabus](https://www.thesyllabus.com/) with focus on backend systems, data pipelines, and machine learning operations.

I'm passionate about building at the intersection of data infrastructure and product design.
I work on high-performance solutions that create lasting organizational impact.
My work bridges data engineering, DevOps, and full-stack development.
I work in a tight-knit, cross-functional team where I architect full-stack data solutions and AI applications using Rust and Python, turning complex data challenges into automated, cost-effective pipelines that drive reliability and meaningful insights.

Before that, I also studied statistics, data science and economics at Washington University.
I contributed technical writing to interdisciplinary social science research during my time at university, now featured in a published manuscript.
My cross-disciplinary background shapes how I approach engineering: I prioritize clarity, context, and documentation. I view system observability and documentation as essential for translating complex stakeholder requirements and user needs into resilient products.

I have a strong background in programming in Python and Rust, as well as software deployment with strong knowledge of fundamentals of Linux, containers, Terraform, and AWS.
I'm also interested in how data, policy, and climate resilience intersect in cities.
